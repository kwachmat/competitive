### What is SPOJ?
SPOJ (Sphere Online Judge) is a problemset archive, online judge and contest hosting service accepting solutions in many languages. Find a problem from one of the extensive problemsets, write a solution in your favorite language and submit it.

### What is CodinGame?
CodinGame is a gamified programming platform where software developers compete together to learn, improve their craft and discover great job opportunities through fun online programming challenges.

In the singleplayer mode, you can face the challenges at many difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard, very hard, optimization (f.e. write the shortest code).

The multiplayer games and contests beside new experience will also bring you a lot of fun, because you have to beat not only AI, but other players.

### Solutions

My solutions are written mostly in C++ or Ruby.

I always try to make my code clear and understandable both for me and others, enjoy.
