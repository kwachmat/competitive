## algorithms

My *Algorithms* repository is a place for algorithmic tasks and puzzles solved by me. Most of the time I try solve at least one task per day if I've got enough time for that. Full list of already beaten tasks can be found here:

##### What is SPOJ?
> SPOJ (Sphere Online Judge) is a problemset archive, online judge and contest hosting service accepting solutions in many languages. Find a problem from one of the extensive problemsets, write a solution in your favorite language and submit it.

##### What is CodinGame?
> CodinGame is a gamified programming platform. Software developers compete together to learn, improve their craft and discover great job opportunities through online programming challenges in singleplayer mode (easy, medium, hard very hard, optimization) or multiplayer games and contests.
